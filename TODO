1. cidr support for ipv4 (and ipv6)
   -also handle :: in IPv6 somehow
2. missing support for non-public IPv6 space, the same way ipv4 ignores private
   networks
3. missing jump logic: -s 9.0.0.0 -e 11.255.255.255 -> 10.x.x.x is private
   jump would have to get done from 9.255.255.255 to 11.0.0.0
4. (maybe) cabable of bruteforcing hostnames if you provide a network.name
   like: XXXXXXX.example.com
5. Threading
6. Handle HOST:Port
 -> [x.x.x.x]:443 as example
